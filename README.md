## **1. Vulnerability Overview**

### 1.1 What is Command Injection?

Command Injection is an attack method enabling arbitrary command execution by injecting malicious code into command-line scripts or applications.

### 1.2 How the Vulnerability Arises

- **Common Scenarios:**
  - Improper input validation.
  - Handling user inputs.
  - Misuse of system commands.

- **System Trust in User Inputs:**
  - Leads to vulnerabilities.

### 1.3 How Does it Work?

1. **Attacker Inserts Malicious Commands:**
   - Via input fields.
2. **System Executes Commands:**
   - Trusting the input.
3. **Malicious Actions:**
   - Data theft, system manipulation.
