What is

Command

Injection?

Command Injection is an attack

method in which an attacker can

execute arbitrary commands on a

system by injecting malicious code

into a command-line script or

application.

Command Injection



<a name="br6"></a> 

How the Vulnerability Arises

•

•

Common scenarios: Improper input

validation, handling user inputs, and

misuse of system commands

System trust in user inputs leading to

vulnerabilities.



<a name="br7"></a> 

How Does it Work?

Step 1: Attacker inserts malicious commands

via input fields.

Step 2: The system, trusting the input, executes

these commands.

Step 3: Malicious actions (e.g., data theft) are

carried out.

How Command Injection is Exploited

1\. Identifying Vulnerable Points:

○ Target Inputs

○ Analyzing Code

2\. Crafting Malicious Inputs:

○ Basic Injection

○ Payloads



<a name="br9"></a> 

Exploiting Command Injection

3\. Testing for Blind Injection:

○

○

Trial and Error

Automated Tools

4\. Executing Commands

○ System Commands

○ Privilege Escalation

5\. Covering Tracks:

○ Minimizing Detection

○ Logging Evasion

Impact of Exploitation

Short-term Consequences:

● Immediate data leaks, system crashes, or unauthorized access.

Long-term Impacts:

● Reputation damage, legal consequences, financial implications.

Patching & Mitigation

Demonstration Benefits:

•

Discussing the advantages of using these

tools for vulnerability assessment.

Interactive vs. Automated:

•

Differentiating between manual testing and

automated scans for command injection.

Patching & Mitigation

Proactive Measures - Input

Validation

•

Validation: Ensuring inputs meet

defined criteria.

•

Sanitization: Cleaning inputs to remove

Patching & Mitigation

Proactive Measures - Whitelisting Inputs

•

•

Definition: Allow only pre-approved, known inputs.

Implementation: Regularly update and review the

whitelist

Proactive Measures - Regular Audits & Monitoring

•

Continuous Monitoring: Regularly scan for

vulnerabilities.

•

Benefits: Early detection, timely response.

Patching & Mitigation

Proactive Measures - Least Privilege Principle

•

•

Definition: Allow only pre-approved, known inputs.

Implementation: Regularly update and review the

whitelist

Proactive Measures - Using Safe APIs

•

Introduction: Transitioning from direct

command execution to safer APIs.

Benefits: Improved security, better error
